# Snake Game
Random snake game done with Xavier during a SmUsh party

This thing is nothing else than a challenge I gave myself of doing a Snake browser game in 10 minutes, before Xav start insulting the quality of my code, and tell me to do it again.

Including classes, structures, functions, thanks to Xavier, modifying my 10 mins snake challenge into a 2 hours coding session.
